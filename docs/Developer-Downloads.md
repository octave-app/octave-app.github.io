# Developer Downloads

These are preview downloads for developers and testers of Octave.app. This page contains prerelease software that may be buggy. Use at your own risk! Though we appreciate you doing so, especially if you [submit bug reports](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/issues). :)

If you are an Octave.app user, you probably want to go to our [main Download page](/Download.html) instead.

The full release history, including all beta releases, can be found on [our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases). Only selected, currently-interesting releases are included in this page.

## Current 8.x and 9.x Series Releases

With native Apple Silicon builds available!

These releases have special installation instructions, due to recent macOS's more aggressive security measures. When you download the DMG file, you must use `xattr -c` to clear the "quarantine" attribute from it before opening it and installing the app. See [bug #244 "app damaged"](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/issues/244) for details.

### 8.4.0 RC 1

[8.4.0 RC 1](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases/tag/v8.4.0_RC1) is Release Candidate 1 for 8.4.0. Posted 2024-04-20. If no significant bugs are found, this exact build will become the GM 8.4.0 release.

### 9.1.0 beta 1

[9.1.0 beta 1](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases/tag/v9.1.0_beta1) is the first 9.1 beta, and first 9.x build at all. This one's still on Qt 5, since the Qt 6 builds aren't working yet. Posted 2024-04-23. An actual 9.x release is a ways off yet.

## Old 6.x Series Releases

6.3.0 beta 1 in late 2021 was as far as we got on this series before development stalled out for a while. 6.2.0 was the last completed 6.x release. As of mid 2023, we've stopped working on the 6.x series for now, and are focusing on getting 8.x and 9.x releases out.

### 6.3.0 beta 1

[Beta 1](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases/tag/v6.3.0-beta1) for Octave.app 6.3.0.
